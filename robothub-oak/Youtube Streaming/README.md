## YouTube streaming application with people detection

This application streams video from OAK (OpenCV AI Kit) devices to YouTube, detecting people in the image in the process. The person-detection-retail-0013 model is used for detection.

### Requirements 

- An OAK device with an RGB sensor is required. Devices such as OAK-D, OAK-D-Lite, OAK-D-Pro or OAK-FFC-4P equipped with an RGB sensor will do.
- You need to register in Youtube Studio and get a stream key.

### Usage

After installing the App, go into the "Configuration" tab in RobotHub and add your stream key. Optionally you can also change the stream FPS and bitrate here. Upon pressing "Save Changes", App will restart itself and start streaming to Youtube. Congratulations, you are now a successful YouTube blogger.
