# Robothub Examples

This repository contains examples of [RobotHub Perception Apps](https://hub-docs.luxonis.com/docs/perception-apps/overview). Examples must be run through RobotHub, they do not serve as stand-alone code and cannot be simply executed locally. 

Based on which libraries are used, Apps can be divided into three categories:
1. Robothub-depthai Apps - Apps based on the [robothub-depthai](https://github.com/luxonis/robothub-depthai) library
